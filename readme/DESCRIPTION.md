# Jibble Connector - Technical Description

## Module Overview

The Jibble Connector module provides seamless integration between the Jibble time tracking platform and Odoo's HR Attendance system. This integration enables automatic synchronization of employee time entries, supporting both real-time updates via webhooks and scheduled batch synchronization.

## Core Features

### 1. Real-time Synchronization
- **Webhook Integration**: Receives real-time notifications from Jibble when time entries are created, updated, or deleted
- **Secure Communication**: Uses HMAC signature verification to ensure webhook authenticity
- **Instant Updates**: Employee attendance records are updated immediately when changes occur in Jibble

### 2. Employee Mapping
- **Flexible Mapping**: Links Jibble users to Odoo employees via configurable user IDs
- **Multi-field Support**: Maps Jibble email addresses and user identifiers
- **Selective Sync**: Allows enabling/disabling synchronization per employee

### 3. Comprehensive Logging
- **Activity Tracking**: Logs all synchronization activities with detailed status information
- **Error Handling**: Captures and logs sync errors with technical details for debugging
- **Audit Trail**: Maintains complete history of all sync operations

### 4. Flexible Configuration
- **Settings Integration**: Configuration through Odoo's standard settings interface
- **API Management**: Secure storage of API keys and organization settings
- **Customizable Intervals**: Configurable automatic sync intervals

## Technical Architecture

### Data Models

#### Extended Employee Model (`hr.employee`)
- `jibble_user_id`: Unique Jibble user identifier
- `jibble_email`: Email address used in Jibble
- `jibble_sync_enabled`: Per-employee sync control
- `last_jibble_sync`: Timestamp of last successful sync

#### Extended Attendance Model (`hr.attendance`)
- `jibble_entry_id`: Reference to original Jibble time entry
- `jibble_activity`: Activity/task information from Jibble
- `jibble_project`: Project assignment from Jibble
- `jibble_location`: Location data from Jibble
- `sync_status`: Current synchronization status

#### Sync Log Model (`jibble.sync.log`)
- Comprehensive logging of all sync operations
- Error tracking and debugging information
- Performance monitoring capabilities

### Integration Components

#### Webhook Controller
- RESTful endpoint at `/jibble/webhook`
- JSON payload processing
- Signature verification
- Event routing and processing

#### Synchronization Engine
